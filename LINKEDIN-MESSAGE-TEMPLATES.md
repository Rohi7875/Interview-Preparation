### Engagement Before Outreach

**Build Relationship First:**

1. **Week 1-2: Engage with their content**
   - Like their posts
   - Comment thoughtfully on their articles
   - Share their content (with your insights)

2. **Week 3: Send connection request**
   - Reference their content you engaged with
   - Be specific and personal

3. **Week 4: After connection accepted**
   - Thank them for connecting
   - Ask about opportunities (if appropriate)
   - Offer value, not just ask

---

### What to Include in Messages

**Always Include:**
‚úÖ Your name and role
‚úÖ Years of experience (if 3+)
‚úÖ Specific skills (2-3 max)
‚úÖ Why you're reaching out

**Never Include:**
‚ùå Life story (keep it brief!)
‚ùå Desperate language
‚ùå Salary questions in first message
‚ùå Multiple links (overwhelming)
‚ùå Negativity about current/past employers

---

### Response Handling

**If They Respond Positively:**
```
"Thanks for getting back to me! I'd love to schedule a brief call. 
I'm available [specific days/times]. What works best for you?"
```

**If They Ask for Resume:**
```
"Absolutely! I've attached my resume. Here's a quick summary of 
recent relevant projects: [2-3 bullet points]. Happy to discuss 
further at your convenience!"
```

**If They Say No Current Openings:**

future opportunities? I'd also be happy to connect you with other 
talented developers if you're ever hiring. Thanks again!"
```

### InMail vs Regular Message

- Note which templates get responses
- Adjust based on response rates
- Personalize top-performing templates

**Key Metrics:**
